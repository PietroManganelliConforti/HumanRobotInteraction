# HumanRobotInteraction
We implemented the Android Studio idle project with the Pepper NAOqi SDK library to
apply it to a virtual Pepper emulator. The NAOqi SDK is a tool of Android Studio that, when
activated allows the use of tools such as Chat Topic files and the virtual 3D emulator of Pepper.
Everything was implemented in Java and the NAOqiSDK-unique language that characterizes
the “.top” files. It has its own syntax as well as its own functions and features. It is mainly used
to develop chatbots. It is implemented using “concepts”, which are basically lists of words and/or
entire sentences that serve as flags for the robot to recognize when speaking with the
user.
